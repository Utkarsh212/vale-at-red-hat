= Installing Vale with the RedHat package system-wide

To use Vale CLI with the `RedHat` style for all folders and projects, install and configure Vale CLI version 2.16.0 or later and create a `.vale.ini` configuration file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are installing Vale for use with a project that already has a Vale configuration, all you need to do is install the Vale command-line tool and run `vale sync` from the project folder.
====

.Prerequisites

* You've installed a recent release of the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[Asciidoctor] Ruby gem on your system.

.Procedure

. Install the Vale command-line tool on your workstation. On RHEL or Fedora systems, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf copr enable mczernek/vale && sudo dnf install vale
----
+
[NOTE]
For other operating systems, see link:https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[Installing Vale].

. Create a `.vale.ini` configuration file and save it in your `$HOME` directory.
+
.Example .vale.ini
[source,ini]
----
include::example$vale.ini[]
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can have multiple `.vale.ini` files for different projects.
`.vale.ini` files that are lower in the folder structure override higher level files.

See link:https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config[Vale configuration reference] for more information.
====

. Download the rules:
+
[source,console]
----
$ vale sync
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ vale sync
 SUCCESS  Downloaded package 'RedHat'
Downloading packages [1/1]
----
+
[TIP]
Run the `vale sync` command periodically to update the `RedHat` Vale package.

.Verification

. Run `vale` against a source file:
+
[source,console,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ cd __<project_directory>__
$ vale __<filename>__
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
