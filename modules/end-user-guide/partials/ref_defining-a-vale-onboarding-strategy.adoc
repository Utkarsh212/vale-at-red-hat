= Defining a vale onboarding strategy

Embracing a linter in a project is a long journey. The full vale report can be discouraging at first. Remember that:

* You are in charge: review the report and decide what is useful to you. 
* The styles are not perfect or complete. 
* Assess the maturity of the project

.Prerequisites
 
* xref:reporting-vale-alerts.adoc[]
* xref:understanding-vale-output.adoc[]

== Assess the project maturity

Zero vale errors::
The project is compliant with the `RedHat` style. Consider integration with a continuous integration service using the defaults from the `{repository-name}` repository.

* xref:using-vale-github-action.adoc[]
* xref:using-vale-with-a-continuous-integration-service.adoc[]

Under 100 Vale errors::
The project is almost compliant with the `RedHat` style. Consider integration with a continuous integration service using the defaults from the `{repository-name}` repository. Consider massively fixing the few errors.

Over 100 Vale errors::
The project is big or poorly compliant with the `RedHat` style. Consider further investigation to understand the issue.

== Start small

* To onboard a collection of repositories, start by the repository with the smallest word count. See xref:reporting-vale-alerts.adoc[]

== Focus on errors

* Display only *errors*. Don't display *warnings* and *suggestions*.

$ vale --minAlertLevel=error .

== Expect false positives

* The _RedHat_ style has been thoroughly tested on a corpus of 113000 words. You can expect false positives when applying the style to a new corpus. Consider xref:contributor-guide:contributing.adoc[] to the style.

== Collect data

* xref:reporting-vale-alerts.adoc[]

* Use the results to identify the rule creating the most errors, and work on that rule. Most probably, start with the Spelling rule.

* Create a custom report targetted at a specific rule and use it to fix your content or identify false positives and link:https://github.com/vale-at-red-hat/vale-at-red-hat/issues[report an issue]. Use custom output templates to generate a custom report. See link:https://docs.errata.ai/vale/cli#--output[Vale documentation - `--output` template].
+
====
For example, for the Spelling rule, you would create a report containing the list of all words reported by the Spelling rule, and count their occurrences. Use that list to differentiate false positives from legit errors. Use the curated list to link:https://github.com/vale-at-red-hat/vale-at-red-hat/issues[report an issue].
====

== Fix the alerts

* Run campaigns focused on one target such as: fix all errors, fix all occurrences of a given rule.

* Disable a rule that is irrelevant in the file context. See: link:https://docs.errata.ai/vale/scoping[Vale - Scoping]
+
----
pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->]

The Spelling rule is ignored for this line.

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->]

The Spelling rule is active for this line.

== Display less alerts without changing the configuration file


* Display only *errors*. Don't display *warnings* and *suggestions*.
+
----
$ vale --minAlertLevel=error .
----

* Display only *errors* and *warnings*. Don't display *suggestions*.
+
----
$ vale --minAlertLevel=warning .

== Contributing to the _{repository-name}_ repository

* xref:contributor-guide:extending-the-spelling-rule.adoc[]

* xref:contributor-guide:extending-the-redhat-style.adoc[]

== Decrease the number of alerts requesting xref:adding-vale-configuration-to-a-project.adoc[]

* xref:creating-a-vocabulary-for-a-project.adoc[]

* Altering *rules* severity or disabling *rules* for the project. See xref:adding-vale-configuration-to-a-project.adoc[] and link:https://docs.errata.ai/vale/config[Vale documentation - configuration].
+
----
RedHat.Annotations = NO
RedHat.Slash = warning
RedHat.Usage = suggestion
